# Horiseon Social Solution Services Webpage

## Description
This Horiseon Social Solution Services webpage includes semantic HTML tags and in-page links. It started as a homework assignment to refactor code for accessibility standards.

## Installation

With this being a project with starter code, the files and folders were already set up to work including:
* index.html file with the HTML code
* assets folder with a css folder and images folder
* Within the assets folder is a style.css file, called upon by index.html
* Within the images folder are all of the graphics and icons used in the webpage

## Usage 

Open the webpage to learn more about Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

The top half of the page provides a navigation bar with in-page links to sections below and an intro image:

<img alt="Top half of the page" src="assets/images/Horiseon-top-section.png"/>

The bottom half of the page provides sections with information on Horiseon's offerings and a side panel with supplemental information, as well as a footer:

## Tests and Known Issues

Test 1:
With the page open, click each link in the navigation bar at the top right of the screen and confirm the page jumps to the appropriate section.

Test 2:
Open the page in different browsers to confirm each element of the page renders as expected.

Known Issue:
In any browser, when the page is resized to a certain width, the side panel is wrapped underneath the main sections.
